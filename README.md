# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Netflix


 Project Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze Netflix's content catalog using structured SQL queries. By working with two key datasets (titles metadata and cast/crew data), we uncover valuable insights into user preferences, content ratings, top-performing genres, and creators. The goal is to derive actionable business intelligence to support strategic decisions in content acquisition, user engagement, and product development.
